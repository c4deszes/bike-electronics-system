[Rotor sensor](https://github.com/c4deszes/bike-rotor-sensor) (or wheel speed sensor) measures wheel
speed, detects braking, flat tire and road inclination.

[Lockout actuator](https://github.com/c4deszes/bike-lockout-actuator) rotates the front suspension
lockout valve to either open (free moving) or closed position which affect the shock absorbing
capability of the fork.

[LINE protocol](https://github.com/c4deszes/bike-line-protocol) is used for communication between
nodes.
