Failure list
============

The following document details the known failures of all products, each failure is categorized
based on severity and priority, lower priority value in this case means higher priority.

The idea behind this list is that the master of the network could detect the failures and then in
some form present them to the user. With a display parts of the active failures could be shown like
the EICAS system on an aircraft.
